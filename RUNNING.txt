Please include clear and simple instructions for running your project.
All tests are created in .fun files and implement the fun language as defined
earlier in the year.
The expected output is found in .ok files which are compared to .out files when
the tests are run, and the result is displayed in .diff files.
We implemented classes so that they could be defined with the following format:
class className {
    //Any instance variables
    x;
    y = 1
    //Any constructors
    className() {
    }
    //Any functions
    fun functionName() {
    }
}
Restrictions: the instances, if any, must come before the constructors, if any,
which must come before the functions, if any, within a class definition. All
previous restrictions of the fun language still hold with regards to naming and
syntax.

Classes are initialized in the format of:
 class = new className(<Parameters>);
and
